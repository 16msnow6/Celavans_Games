# Celavans_Games
this portfolio was initally created as a final for a recent Web development class i took, and contains some of my best,(and worst) work. most of the games have been created in years past for diferent projects.
-my first ever html game was the mine-sweeper game, and was the first ever thing i programmed, since then it has gone through many clean up's and is now the product shown here.
-the next project here i have worked on was the Snake game as a chalange between me and some friends, to see who could create the best game in a week(with also having to deal with high-school finals coming up) it has also gone through a couple major clean up's since it's inital creation.
-the tick tack toe game was initally suposed to be a multi-player server based game using node-js, but as that did not fit well with this, i had to quickly modify it to fit better in a clint side purly format. it is the only of these which I created in a group.
-the most recent of these games is the Checker's game, which was created as my teacher introdueced us to angular JS. I never got around to enforcing turns, however, i beleve it has the best user-interaction.


# planned:
-I currently have in development a modified snake game, which i plan on turning into a troll game for the Youtuber CarlSagan42. currently i have created a checkpoint system, the ability to add apples where i want, or at a random location if desired, a changing board size, and an easy way to manage all the above. currently i am developing a way to change the speed of the snake, and have planned poisonous apples.
