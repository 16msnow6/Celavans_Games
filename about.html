	<h3>about the site</h3>
	<p>
		this website is a bunch of html games i have created over the years,
		now cleaned up, and mostly presentable.
		In cleaning these up, i have tried to keep the spirit of the original project, not wanting to have to completly re-invent the wheel. even if in some cases, it would have turned out better.
		This page will also serve as a Portfolio for
		any other HTML/JS games i make in the	future.
		I have worked hard on many of these.
		i hope you enjoy.

		<h3>My story:</h3>
		<p>
			Back in 2013-2014, the government did an "hour of code initiative", wich many of my teachers offered me extra credit if i did.
			going through the options on the website, i realised that most of the options i couldn't use anywhere else, for they had so far abstracted away from anything that was real programming, that it was obvious that the skills were not transferable.
			wanting to learn skills i could use elsewhere, i skimmed through the list, till i found one that mentioned "javascript", a word that sounded familiar from elsewhere.
			at that point i decided to learn javascript.
			from that tutorial, i made a rock paper scisors example, wich was still so far abstracted that it still could not be used in this website, but i had my foot in the door, and i was going to find a way to use my knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			after a bit of trying to figure out how to use my new found knolege in a usefull way, and a divertion into java, and finding it is not the same as javascript, eventually in mid 2014, i took a web development classs where i learned basic HTML.
			in the middle of this, i learned that i could use my javascript knowlege to modify html, at wich point i took on a chalange that was way over my dificulty curve at the time. 
			our family had recently upgraded to windows 10, and i was missing XP's minesweeper, so i wanted to make it myself.
			over the course of the next three months, i finally pulled off the first project that could be cleaned up and put in this website, minesweeper.
		</p>
			since then, i have worked on many other projects using html, javascript, including a few full fledged websites not presented here. 
			now five years later, i know so much more, if not only that i know good programming practices, how to keep my code clean, and fast, and so much more.
